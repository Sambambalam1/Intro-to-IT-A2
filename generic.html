                            <h2>IT Work</h2>
                            <p>In this part of the assignment, we were asked to speak to a IT Professional and ask questions about the industry. The questions were revolved around what type of work was done and its challenges. I chose to speak to one of my dear friends Vuthy Keo who works as a Product manager at PaperCut. PaperCut is a print management software which makes printing easier for clients. I asked Vuthy to answer the questions as if he was speaking for the IT industry as whole to give us a bigger picture of what goes on. I organized a phone call between us 2 where Vuthy said he would not like me to record the conversation but allowed me time to write down his answers. He also helped me typed a couple of the answers to allow a more first hand answer.</p>
							</ol> 
                                    <ul>
<li>	<strong>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;       </strong>
  IT professionals are responsible for a variety of responsibilities. They are those who, in one or more places, test, develop, install, repair, or maintain the hardware and software involved with advanced computer systems.
Once hired, an IT professional will be continually learning new IT skills and receiving training. This is due to the fact that not every firm served by IT experts will utilize the same coding language, operating system, database tool, or technique.
      </li>                                        
<li><strong>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are the other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</strong>IT professionals come in a variety of forms. Each type concentrates on a different aspect of computer system analysis or upkeep. A programmer, for example, is an IT professional who writes computer code to develop computer platforms and programs. This is a common entry-level position, but as programmers advance, they take on more responsibilities. These duties include leading their teams and repairing a broken or malfunctioning programs.
Depending on the field of the IT Profession, they will work with different types of people. Mainly they work with clients and customers to create solutions for their problems. For example, a Web administrator Sets up a web host for an organization, allows access to certain users, installs mail servers, and assists users in learning the basics of the system they're using. A computer scientist uses their technology knowledge and resources to help businesses overcome IT challenges.

</li>
<li><strong>•Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</strong>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In order to manage its diverse network of computer systems, some firms may recruit several IT specialists from across the world. Because of the nature of the internet, IT workers can work from anywhere. However, in other cases, such as when there is a hardware problem, the IT specialist will have to physically change the faulty system.</li>
                                        <li><strong>•What aspect of their position is most challenging?</strong>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; To say the least, a person's life in the IT profession is highly chaotic. It is not a typical 9 to 5 corporate job, when you show up for work at 9 a.m. and leave at 5 p.m., leaving behind all of your problems and anxieties for the day until the next day. Unfortunately, your work follows you home in the form of email and a laptop. You can get calls from clients, managers, and even coworkers at any inconvenient time of the day. They'll bother you with demands for more work, all of which will have a deadline in the next few hours.
If you think work is the greatest issue, you don't understand the IT industry. The most serious issue is that the quality of your work is rarely considered when you are being evaluated. After all, this was your job, and you were expected to complete it. What counts most is what you've done "outside of your" job: the trainings you've taken, the certifications you've earned, the company-wide events you've taken part in, and, most crucially, are you on your boss's good side!

                              <h2>IT Technologies</h2>
                        <h3><strong>What does it do? (600 words) What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</strong></h3>
                        <p>
Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence and is a computer algorithm that automatically improves through experience. Machine learning does a lot of things. For example, machine learning has been used in a wide variety of domains these days, such as distinguishing whether it is spam or not by e-mail, guessing what animal it is by looking at animal photos, translating, playing games instead of game players, or driving automatically. Machine learning can be largely divided into three categories. One is supervision learning, second is unsupervised learning, and third is reinforcement learning. Supervised learning refers to a model in which the correct answer is displayed on the data entering the input of machine learning. Unsupervised learning refers to a model in which the correct answer is not displayed in the data entering the input of machine learning as opposed to supervision learning. Reinforcement learning is a method in which an agent defined within an environment recognizes the current state and selects an action or sequence of actions that maximizes compensation among selectable actions. 
</p>
							<p>Machine learning has already surpassed human intelligence in certain fields. For example, in the field of guessing what kind of object it is only by looking at pictures, it has already been much higher than human accuracy. Tesla's self-driving model also has a lower accident rate than human’s drive. In addition, Deepmind's AlphaGo won the game against humans. Auto machine learning, which automatically determines machine learning's hyper parameter, is also being developed, and a copilot, which automatically codes by Microsoft, has also been released. However, there was a limitation in that machine learning had to develop models only targeting specific fields. So, recently, people are developing domain agnostic machine learning, and papers are actually very active. This is causing a very big impact on the machine learning world.</p>
                        <p>As expected, a stable domain agnostic model is expected to emerge within three years, and a model that learns regardless of field as real humans think. In addition, the autonomous driving model is expected to be more stable and completely passed in the bill, commercializing even a very high level of driving technology. In addition, small machines (e.g., mobile phones, refrigerators, television, air conditioners, etc.) that are difficult to obtain many computing resources will also have good performance and many lightweight models. Additionally, hardware development for machine learning is also under development by so many researchers that models that are more powerful, faster, and predictable are expected to be developed. In addition to developing hardware, distributed machine learning models that run learning on multiple computers at the same time are being actively developed.</p>
                        <p>For these technologies to be developed, as mentioned earlier, hardware only for machine learning must be developed, and distributed machine learning must be developed. With the development of these technologies, the machine learning model can learn faster, which is the same as the prediction speed. In order to develop this, network elements that constitute distributed machine learning should also be developed, and hardware that can handle fast networks should also be developed. For hardware to be developed for machine learning, it is necessary to develop a technology that allows hardware and software to match peer to peer.
A large amount of data is required to learn machine learning. To this end, more machines or devices capable of collecting data must be developed and distributed. In addition, data should be labeled for supervision learning, and a machine that automatically does this is expected to save a lot of human trouble. It is difficult for machines to classify them all accurately. Human labor must be included, and it is expected that it will be helpful if a lot of professional manpower is nurtured.

                        <h3><strong>What is the likely impact? (300 words) What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</strong></h3>
                        <p>Machine learning is already very much incorporated into our lives. For example, when I wake up in the morning, I look at my cell phone and unlock my cell phone with face recognition. I shop on my cell phone, and recommended items appear as pop-ups. While driving, turn on the autonomous driving mode, cope only with emergencies, and drive relatively comfortably. I use a translator using machine learning because I have to translate while working. Machine learning is used in many fields, including these examples.</p> 
                        <p>Machine learning is still being developed additionally. Like in the movie, you can clean it up instead, or ask robots using machine learning to work. To predict a little closer future, you can interview interviewers using machine learning, and a very fast translation model that translates as soon as you hear it can also be developed.</p>
                        <p>With the development of machine learning, people's jobs are being replaced. For example, it is expected to replace the work of a service counselor within a few years, and it is said that the work of a banker can also be replaced by machine learning. In addition, in some cases, machine learning provides primary treatment, and doctors provide treatment. In addition, there are many companies that invest in machine learning by predicting stock prices instead of stock traders.</p>
                        <p>First of all, I think there is a high possibility of replacing people who do simple tasks. As mentioned earlier, people who do relatively simple tasks such as fast-food clerks, accounting clerks, couriers, and gas sources are likely to replace them. On the contrary, jobs that require creativity, such as animation writers and designers, are unlikely to be replaced, and jobs that inevitably require human judgment in emergency situations such as doctors, pilots, and childcare are unlikely to be replaced.</p>
                        <h3><strong>How will this affect you? (300 words) In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</strong></h3>
                        <p>As Section 2 said, machine learning already has a great influence on my life. To be more specific, the technology needed to wake up in the morning and unlock the smartphone lock is to guess whether my face is registered on the smartphone. Through this technology, the lock can be unlocked more quickly, conveniently, and securely. Also, recommending items at shopping malls is recommending through the recommendation system. It is to recommend items by considering all my personal information, the items I saw, and how long I have seen them. Similarly, services such as YouTube also recommend items using a recommendation system. There are so many considerations in autonomous driving. First, there is a need for a technology that recognizes the situation ahead similarly to when humans drive through cameras. Accordingly, a lot of factors are used, such as how close it is to the car in front, whether there is a crosswalk, how the traffic light signal has changed, and whether a pedestrian is in front of it. In addition to this, data is obtained through various sensors and decisions are made. Translators using machine learning also use models using natural language processing techniques. It is to infer, understand, and translate the meaning of each word by replacing it with words of other languages with the most similar meaning. In addition, when playing games, players who use machine learning instead of actual players enter the game and make it more fun for users. I think this is a model learned through reinforcement learning.
I think my family and friends are in the same situation as me. I think there will be an intervention of machine learning in a wide variety of fields like me, and they will be receiving help from machine learning. They will also use YouTube or shopping mall services, play games, and use translators.
As such, machine learning has a great influence on our lives and is likely to develop further. As the impact of machine learning on us has grown significantly, it is necessary to wisely think about how to adapt to a rapidly changing society and how appropriate it is.
